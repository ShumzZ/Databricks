# Databricks

A collection of projects I have done and/or quick how-to guides I have complied over time on [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)\
If you are utilizing Spark for data analytics and data science projects and would like some awsome built-in visualization tools and features, check out the community (free) version [here](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)

Note: All the .ipynb files are converted from Databricks directly.\
If they can not be rendered properly here on Github, please copy and paste the link to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
